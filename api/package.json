  "description": "This folder contains the source code for the back-end component of the financial education platform. The back-end is being built using Node.js and is responsible for handling data storage, user authentication, and other server-side functionality. The team is committed to creating a scalable and reliable back-end that can handle a large number of users and transactions. The code in this folder is organized into separate modules and endpoints for easy maintenance and testing. The back-end communicates with the front-end using a RESTful API, and any changes or updates to the API are documented in the project's issue tracker. The code in this folder is version controlled using Git, and any changes or updates are reviewed and approved by the team's lead developer before being merged into the main branch.",
