This folder contains the source code for the front-end component of the financial education platform. The front-end is being built using React and is responsible for providing a user-friendly interface for the platform's features and functionality. The team is committed to creating an intuitive and responsive front-end that can enhance the user experience. The code in this folder is organized into separate components and modules for easy maintenance and testing. The front-end communicates with the back-end using a RESTful API. The code in this folder is version controlled using Git, and any changes or updates are reviewed and approved by the team's lead developer before being merged into the main branch.
